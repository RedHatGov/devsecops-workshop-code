# Add Test Stage

Add the configuration for the Test Stage below to your pipeline text file.

Maven will run the test stage in the life cycle that we skipped at the previous stages.

Maven will place the test results in the surefire-reports folder.  The maven surefire-reports plugin allows for the generation of reports for your unit tests.

Append the text below to the bottom of the Jenkins Pipeline Configuration.  Please make sure to append to the beginning of the next line.  

```copy
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh "${mvnCmd} test"
        step([$class: 'JUnitResultArchiver', testResults: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'])
      }
    }

# Test Your Pipeline
If you'd like to do a test of first pipeline stage, add the following brackets at the end of your Jenkinsfile. Make sure to append to the beginning of the last line.

```copy
  }
}

```

Save your Jenkinsfile.

Go back to Builds > Pipelines

# Delete Brackets
Please delete the brackets you just added once testing is complete. We can add them later if you'd like to test your pipeline as you go along.
