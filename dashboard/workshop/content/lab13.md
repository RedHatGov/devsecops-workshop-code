# Add Promote to Stage
Enter the Promote to STAGE below into your pipeline.

We set an approval to promote to the application to the Stage Project.  The approval process is a good feature for various gates of your deployments.  We also set a 15 minute timeout on the approval.  You also tag the tasks image with latest and the version from the pom file.

Append the text below to the bottom of the Jenkins Pipeline Configuration.  Please make sure to append to the beginning of the next line.  

```copy
    stage('Promote to STAGE?') {
      steps {
        timeout(time:15, unit:'MINUTES') {
            input message: "Promote to STAGE?", ok: "Promote"
        }

        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            openshift.tag("${env.DEV_PROJECT}/tasks:latest", "${env.STAGE_PROJECT}/tasks:${version}")
          }
        }
      }
    }

# Add Deploy Stage

Add the Deploy Stage into your pipeline.

<img src="images/pipeline_deploy_stage.png" width="900" />

If the deployment config for the application already exists in the Stage Project or Environment the deployment config , service, and route are deleted.  This allows for the pipeline to be rerun.

The new-app is recreated in the Stage Environment from the image that you tagged in the previous stage.  The image also has a route created for with the svc.expose command.

      }
    }
  }
}

```      

Congratulations, this should be the final step in your Trusted Software Supply Chain.  Go on to the next lab to verify and run the pipeline.
