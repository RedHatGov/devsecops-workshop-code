In your pipeline, verify the following variables are there after the version and mvnCmd definitions.  Please fill in the values between the quotes if not done previously.

- ocuser : the openshift user given to you by your insturctor
- ocpass : the openshift password given to you by your insturctor
- ocp : the openshift host given to you by your instuctor

```copy
def ocuser = " "
def ocpass = " "
def ocp = " "

```

For Example:

```copy
def ocuser = "%username%"
def ocpass = "openshift"
def ocp = "{{< urishortfqdn "" "master" "" >}}"

```

In your pipeline, make sure you replaced the Jenkins agent 'maven' with 'jenkins-slave-image-mgmt'.

```copy
pipeline {
  agent {
    label 'jenkins-slave-image-mgmt'
  }

```

In your pipeline, add the OpenSCAP DISA STIG Scan after the Container Vulnerability Scan Stage.

```copy
    stage('OSCAP DISA STIG Scan') {
      steps {
          sh "oc login -u $ocuser -p $ocpass --insecure-skip-tls-verify https://$ocp 2>&1"
          sh "sshpass -p $ocpass ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -t $ocuser@$ocp docker login -u $ocuser -p " + '"$(oc whoami -t)"' + " docker-registry-default.apps.$ocp"
          sh "sshpass -p $ocpass ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -t $ocuser@$ocp docker pull docker-registry-default.apps.$ocp/dev-$ocuser/tasks:latest"
          sh "sshpass -p $ocpass ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -t $ocuser@$ocp sudo oscap-docker image docker-registry-default.apps.$ocp/dev-$ocuser/tasks:latest xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig-rhel7-disa --report report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml"
        }
      } 
      
```
