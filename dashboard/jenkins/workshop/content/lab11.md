# Add Build Image Stage

Add the Build Image Stage into your pipeline.

<img src="images/pipeline_oc_build_image.png" width="900" />

The "sh" are shell commands in your pipeline that are executed on the Jenkins Slave.  Maven built the openshift-tasks.war in it the target directory and it will be copied into the created oc-builds directory.

The startBuild stage is kicked off from Openshift and pointing to the local directory "oc-build" on the Jenkins slave.

        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            openshift.withProject(env.DEV_PROJECT) {
              openshift.selector("bc", "tasks").startBuild("--from-dir=oc-build", "--wait=true")
