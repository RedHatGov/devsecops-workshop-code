Jenkins can be integrated with OpenShift in 3 ways.  Today, you'll be working with a containerized Jenkins Server that's fully integrated with OpenShift.

Click Login with OpenShift.

Login with your OpenShift Credentials. You maybe asked to accept authorizations. Go ahead and do so and re-login.

Jenkins follows a master/agent architecture.  Your pipeline will run a process called a Jenkins executor.  A Jenkins executor is one of the basic building blocks which allow a build to run on an agent (e.g. build server). Think of an executor as a single “process ID”, or as the basic unit of resource that Jenkins executes on your machine to run a build.
