# The registry.redhat.io service account pull secret
# This is needed to access the authenticated Red Hat registry (e.g. to pull
#   JBoss images). To get a service account, to go:
#     https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
#   login with your Red Hat credentials, then go to Service Accounts (upper
#   right corner) and create a new service account. Click on the name of the
#   service account, go to the 'OpenShift Secret' tab, click 'view its
#   contents,' and then copy value after `.dockerconfigjson` into this var.
# It is recommended to generate a new service account before a workshop and
#   delete it after, as this token is available in each of the users' projects
#   (and can be used in the future if the service account isn't deleted)

# Uncomment the following to change the pipeline workflow from Tekton to Jenkins
# NOTE: Not really implemented yet....
# pipeline_style: jenkins

# Uncomment the following to change the actions that occur before workshop deployment
# create_users: no      # You should only do this if you're not trying to deploy much of anything
# autoscale: no         # You should only do this if you know your workload will fit on your cluster as is
# adjust_console: no    # This changes the route for the console to `console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` which is much shorter than the default.

# NOTE: OCS will make your cluster much larger (and more expensive). Consider
#   disabling OCS and 3scale (which requires RWX, so either OCS or its own S3
#   bucket) if you are price sensitive.
# deploy_ocs: no  # This OCS deployment only _currently_ works on AWS. It should theoretically work without AWS creds on AWS (for example, RHPDS-provisioned clusters on AWS)

# You can disable these by uncommenting the lines below. They all default to YES.
# deploy_quay: no
# deploy_service_mesh: no
# deploy_gitea: no
# deploy_sonarqube: no
# deploy_nexus: no
# deploy_3scale: no
# deploy_crw: no
# deploy_pipeline: no
# deploy_workshop: no

# Uncomment this line to deploy the bookinfo application to Service Mesh and 3scale (it defaults to NO)
# deploy_bookinfo: yes

# 3scale specific:
#   3scale requires RWX storage to deploy. If you deploy OCS and 3scale in the
#     provisioner, it will user RWX storage provided by OCS's CephFS file type.
#     If you don't deploy OCS, you will need to include the following variables:
# rwx_backing_style: s3
# aws_region: us-east-1
# rwx_backing_s3_bucket: bucket_name

# If using AWS S3 to back 3scale, ensure the AWS credentials you intend for
#   3scale, which are already configured with read/write access to the bucket
#   above (which should also be already created!), are either in the environment
#   by exporting them, or you can set them here (where they will override those
#   in environment, in case you were provisioning with different accesses):
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <key>
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <secret>
