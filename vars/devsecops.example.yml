# NOTE: If the operators themselves still point to another image on Quay, the
#   operator coming from this repo won't affect the images themselves.


# Uncomment the following to change the pipeline workflow from Tekton to Jenkins
# pipeline_style: jenkins


# NOTE: OCS will make your cluster much larger (and more expensive). Consider
#   disabling OCS and 3scale (which requires RWX, so either OCS or its own S3
#   bucket) if you are price sensitive.
# You can disable these by uncommenting the lines below.

# deploy_ocs: no  # This OCS deployment only _currently_ works on AWS. It should theoretically work without AWS creds on AWS (for example, RHPDS-provisioned clusters on AWS)
# deploy_quay: no
# deploy_service_mesh: no
# deploy_gitea: no
# deploy_sonarqube: no
# deploy_nexus: no
# deploy_3scale: no
# deploy_crw: no
# deploy_pipeline: no


# 3scale specific:
#   3scale requires RWX storage to deploy. If you deploy OCS and 3scale in the
#     provisioner, it will user RWX storage provided by OCS's CephFS file type.
#     If you don't deploy OCS, you will need to include the following variables:
# rwx_backing_style: s3
# aws_region: us-east-1
# rwx_backing_s3_bucket: bucket_name

# If using AWS S3 to back 3scale, ensure the AWS credentials you intend for
#   3scale, which are already configured with read/write access to the bucket
#   above (which should also be already created!), are either in the environment
#   by exporting them, or you can set them here (where they will override those
#   in environment, in case you were provisioning with different accesses):
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <key>
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <secret>
