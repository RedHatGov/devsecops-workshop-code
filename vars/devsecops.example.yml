# The project from which custom Operators will be pulled

# NOTE: If the operators themselves still point to another image on Quay, the
#   operator coming from this repo won't affect the images themselves.

# Uncomment the following to change the pipeline workflow from Tekton to Jenkins
# pipeline_style: jenkins


# NOTE: OCS will make your cluster much larger (and more expensive). Consider
#   disabling OCS and 3scale (which requires RWX, so either OCS or its own S3
#   bucket) if you are price sensitive.
# You can disable these by uncommenting the lines below.
# deploy_ocs: no
# deploy_quay: no
# deploy_service_mesh: no
# deploy_gitea: no
# deploy_sonarqube: no
# deploy_nexus: no
# deploy_3scale: no
# deploy_pipeline: no
