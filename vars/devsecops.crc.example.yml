#     https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
#   login with your Red Hat credentials, then go to Service Accounts (upper
#   right corner) and create a new service account. Click on the name of the

# It is recommended to generate a new service account before a workshop and
#   delete it after, as this token is available in each of the users' projects
#   (and can be used in the future if the service account isn't deleted)
